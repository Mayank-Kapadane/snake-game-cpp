# Snake Apple Game in C++

## Overview
This project is a classic Snake game implemented in C++. The objective is to control a snake to eat apples that appear randomly on the screen. Each time the snake eats an apple, it grows longer, and the game speeds up. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the walls.
